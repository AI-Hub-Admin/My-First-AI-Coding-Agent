AI Agent Registry Demo project

## Demo Schema of AI Agent Marketplace Registry

Note that the "id" automatic generated from your "{owner_name}/{repo_name}" format to avoid conflicts in agents.
The id field is unique identifier and can't changed and be different from your "{owner_name}/{repo_name}". Your `access_key` is authenticated to know your "owner_name"
and updated "name" field is your {repo_name}. 

For example, the registered unique id of agent will be "AI-Hub-Admin/My-First-AI-Coding-Agent"
